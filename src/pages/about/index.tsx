        i ran an astrology blog on tumblr when i was thirteen. i also grew a tiny readership answering random questions on quora. i was even a charli xcx fan on twitter which i later quit to pursue middle school full-time.  iâ€™ve grown a lot since then, but i still carry the experience of having lived many, many digital lives into the work i do today. at harvard, i study computer science and philosophy, where i hope to understand how technology interfaces with societies, cultures, and values.
